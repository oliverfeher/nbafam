# NBA FAMILY

Welcome to the NBA Family application. This project was build for Flatiron Schoold software engineering boot camp. Based on object oriented Ruby and Nokogiri/Open-URI libraries.

The app displays all 30 teams of the NBA. You can search them by index number or by entering the team's city/name. Upon team selection you are shown the team's current roster, and general information about the selected team.

I hope you enjoy it! Feel free to contact me, my information is listed under option #4 from the main menu.
